## Executive Summary

India's electric vehicle market exhibits a complex growth trajectory characterized by market consolidation, geographic concentration, and category bifurcation. While absolute sales volumes have contracted significantly year-over-year, the increasing EV penetration rate and emerging high-growth geographies signal a maturing market shifting from volume-driven expansion to profit-driven consolidation.

**Key Paradox**: Volume decline (-66.2%) concurrent with penetration growth (+31.14%) indicates market rationalization rather than demand collapse.
